This machine learning project predicts whether a people have diabetes based on features like Glucose , Insulin Level , Age , BMI etc ...
Data Analysis is Performed on this dataset to check how much impact each feature has on the outcome
Dataset is splitted into testing and training
Machine learning Algorithms like Decision Tree Classifier and Naive Bayes are applied and performance of the each model are evaluated
