MY MODULE:
  Data Splitting, Model Building using Logistic Regression and Support VectorMachine
  
STEPS INVOLVED IN MY MODULE:
1.	Import the necessary package and load the dataset.
2.	Build a correlation matrix using heatmap.
3.	Pre process the dataset.
4.	Splitting the dataset into 70% training data and 30% testing data.
5.	Building a Logistic Regression classifier and Support Vector Machine classifier.
6.	Predict the target Outcome.
7.	Evaluating the accuracy of the model.
8.	Model tuning to improve the accuracy of the model.
